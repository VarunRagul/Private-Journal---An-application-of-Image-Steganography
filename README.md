# Private-Journal---An-application-of-Image-Steganography
Network Security and Cryptography Application

This project aims to explore the Least Significant Bit technique of encoding, where the last bit of each pixel is modified and replaced with the data bit of the secret message. Using this technique, we have made a simple application that allows a user to encode their journal entry into their image, and also decode, and get back their writings from the image.
